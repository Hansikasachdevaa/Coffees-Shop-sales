# Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
Welcome to my Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis project! In this project, I have created an insightful dashboard using Excel, analyzing key sales data from a coffee shop. The dashboard provides a clear view of sales trends, top-selling products, customer preferences, and more, all through Excel's powerful tools and functions.

## Key Objectives
### 1. Sales Data Analysis  
- Utilized advanced Excel techniques to track and analyze total sales over time.  
- Incorporated formulas and pivot tables to calculate sales per product category and identify high-performance periods.

### 2. Product Performance Insights  
- Focused on product-level analysis to determine which items contributed the most to sales.  
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight top-performing products and trends.  
- Filtered data to create a breakdown of sales based on different product categories.

### 3. Customer Behavior Evaluation  
- Leveraged Excel to segment customer data and assess purchasing behavior.  
- Created charts to visualize the top customers based on total spend, frequency, and recency of purchases.

### 4. Sales Trends Visualization  
- Designed a dashboard that visualizes sales trends over different time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly).  
- Created interactive features using Excel to allow for easy data exploration and insights discovery.

## Enhanced Data Visualization
- The dashboard includes multiple Excel charts (bar, line, and pie charts) to make sales and product data easily digestible.  
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, sales growth, and best-selling products are visually represented for quick interpretation.

## Business Insights
The dashboard provided the following insights:  
- **Sales Growth Over Time:** Identified periods with the highest growth and sales peaks.  
- **Product Distribution:** Pinpointed which coffee types and sizes were most popular.  


## Project Conclusion
This Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard is a clear example of how Excel can be used to transform raw data into actionable business insights. Iâ€™ve utilized multiple Excel features such as pivot tables, advanced formulas, and data visualization techniques to create a comprehensive tool for understanding sales performance and customer behavior.
